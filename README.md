# GridView Like Facebook

To keep it simple I wanted a Gridview that did the samething as the one in the application facebook did.  What i mean by this is that when the user scrolls down the top navigation menu hides its self and when the user scrolls up the menu shows it self again and if the users scrolls down it hides it self again.

I did not find any toolkits that already had this feature so naturally being a developer I built one.
the code will he here soon with an example
