# GridView Like Facebook

To keep it simple I wanted a Gridview that did the samething as the one in the application facebook did.  What i mean by this is that when the user scrolls down the top navigation menu hides its self and when the user scrolls up the menu shows it self again and if the users scrolls down it hides it self again.

I did not find any toolkits that already had this feature so naturally being a developer I built one.
This code only works for Windows Phone 8.1 WinRT apps. 

##App1
the converter that allows you to modifiy the margin of the top bar is called ScrollToMarginConverter, in app1 you will find that you will be able to ease in and ease out the top navigation bar.  However that is not what I wanted to do at first!

So i created App2
